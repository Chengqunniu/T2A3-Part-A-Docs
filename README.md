### Purpose

This project aims to develop a full-stack web application for the sticker shop that serves the following purposes:

* The website displays all of the sticker shop's products, allowing customers to view product details online.
* By creating a website, more people interested in stickers will be able find this sticker brand through a Google search, which increases shop's exposure.
* Customers could shop online and wait for the delivery at home, which saves their time.
  
### Features

This sticker shop application will have the following features:

* Customers can click the 'Checkout' button on the Cart page to navigate to a Checkout page where they could fill in their addresses for delivery and place orders

Above are the basic features of the sticker shop application. If we have enough time, (some of) the following features might be implemented:

* Customers are able to register and login to view their order history
* Customers are able to post comments on the products they purchased as feedback for shop owners and references for potential customers who are interested in the same product.

## User Stories

1. As a scrapbooker, I find it time-consuming to visit different brick-and-mortar craft stores or sticker shops to collect materials in good design. I want to view a collection of sticker and washi tape products on an online platform, so that I can quickly find the products I want to buy.
2. As a scrapbooker, I consume large numbers of scrapbook stickers and washi tapes daily and I constantly need to buy new ones. I want to be able to place orders online, so that I can save the trouble of commuting to a brick-and-mortar sticker shop to buy what I need. 
3. As a scrapbooker, I am very picky with the design of the stickers and washitapes used for scrapbooking. I want to be able to contact a sticker shop when there are no satisfying products, so that I can describe my preferred design pattern to the shop owner and hopefully they could find matching products for me.
